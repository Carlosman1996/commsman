FEATURES PLAN:

Hereâ€™s a list of **valuable features** and **expectations** a user might have for a system that organizes requests into folders, manages Modbus connections, and displays results. These ideas focus on **user experience**, **functionality**, and **practical use cases** without diving into code.

---

### **1. User Expectations for Requests**

#### **Inputs for Requests**
- **Modbus Operation Type**:
  - Read holding registers, input registers, coils, or discrete inputs.
  - Write single register, multiple registers, single coil, or multiple coils.
- **Address and Data**:
  - Register addresses (e.g., 0, 40001).
  - Data types (e.g., uint16, int32, float).
  - Values to write (for write operations).
- **Slave ID**:
  - Specify the Modbus slave ID for the request (if different from the folderâ€™s default).
- **Custom Labels**:
  - Allow users to name requests for easier identification (e.g., "Read Temperature Sensor").
- **Conditional Logic**:
  - Define conditions for executing requests (e.g., "Run only if Register X > 100").
- **Retry Mechanism**:
  - Specify the number of retries and delay between retries for failed requests.

#### **Outputs for Requests**
- **Raw Data**:
  - Display the raw response from the Modbus device (e.g., register values).
- **Processed Data**:
  - Convert raw data into meaningful values (e.g., temperature, pressure).
- **Status**:
  - Indicate success, failure, or timeout for each request.
- **Timestamps**:
  - Log when the request was executed and how long it took.
- **Error Details**:
  - Provide detailed error messages for debugging (e.g., "Connection timeout", "Invalid address").
- **Visual Feedback**:
  - Use color coding (e.g., green for success, red for failure) in the tree view or UI.

---

### **2. User Expectations for Folders**

#### **Inputs for Folders**
- **Modbus Connection Settings**:
  - IP address, port, slave ID, and timeout for the shared Modbus connection.
- **Folder Name and Description**:
  - Allow users to name and describe the folder (e.g., "Boiler Sensors").
- **Request Organization**:
  - Group related requests into folders (e.g., "Temperature Sensors", "Pressure Sensors").
- **Shared Variables**:
  - Define variables that can be shared across requests in the folder (e.g., a common register address or scaling factor).
- **Scheduling**:
  - Set a schedule for running all requests in the folder (e.g., every 5 minutes, at specific times).

#### **Outputs for Folders**
- **Aggregated Results**:
  - Display a summary of all requests in the folder (e.g., "5/10 requests succeeded").
- **Folder-Level Logs**:
  - Log all activities within the folder (e.g., connection status, request execution times).
- **Exportable Data**:
  - Allow users to export folder results to CSV, Excel, or JSON for further analysis.
- **Visualization**:
  - Provide charts or graphs for trends in folder results (e.g., temperature over time).

### **3. Valuable Features for Users**

#### **1. Drag-and-Drop Interface**
- Allow users to drag and drop requests into folders or reorder them for execution priority.

#### **2. Template Library**
- Provide pre-built templates for common Modbus operations (e.g., reading temperature, writing to a relay).
- Allow users to save their own templates for reuse.

#### **3. Real-Time Monitoring**
- Continuously monitor Modbus devices and update the tree view in real time.
- Highlight changes in values (e.g., "Temperature increased by 5Â°C").

#### **4. Alerts and Notifications**
- Set up alerts for specific conditions (e.g., "Notify me if Register X > 100").
- Send notifications via email, SMS, or in-app messages.

#### **5. Batch Execution**
- Run all requests in a folder sequentially or in parallel.
- Provide options for stopping execution if a request fails.

#### **6. Historical Data**
- Store historical results for each request and folder.
- Allow users to view trends over time (e.g., "Temperature over the last 24 hours").

#### **7. User Permissions**
- Define roles and permissions for different users (e.g., admin, operator, viewer).
- Restrict access to sensitive folders or operations.

#### **8. Import/Export Folders**
- Allow users to import/export folders for sharing or backup.
- Support common formats like JSON or YAML.

#### **9. Custom Scripting**
- Allow advanced users to write custom scripts for complex logic (e.g., "If Register X > 100, write to Register Y").
- Support Python or JavaScript for scripting.

#### **10. Multi-Device Support**
- Allow users to define multiple Modbus connections in a single folder.
- Switch between devices dynamically during execution.

#### **11. Data Validation**
- Validate request inputs (e.g., ensure register addresses are within range).
- Provide feedback for invalid configurations.

#### **12. Offline Mode**
- Allow users to prepare requests and folders offline.
- Sync with devices when a connection is available.

#### **13. Integration with Other Systems**
- Integrate with SCADA systems, databases, or cloud platforms.
- Support protocols like MQTT or OPC UA for data sharing.

#### **14. Customizable UI**
- Allow users to customize the tree view, charts, and dashboards.
- Save user preferences for future sessions.

#### **15. Documentation and Help**
- Provide built-in documentation for Modbus operations and folder management.
- Include tooltips and examples for new users.

### **4. Example Use Cases**

#### **Industrial Automation**
- Monitor and control sensors, actuators, and PLCs in a manufacturing plant.
- Group requests by machine or production line.

#### **Energy Management**
- Read energy consumption data from smart meters.
- Set up alerts for abnormal usage patterns.

#### **Building Automation**
- Control HVAC systems, lighting, and security devices.
- Schedule requests to optimize energy usage.

#### **Research and Testing**
- Test Modbus devices in a lab environment.
- Log and analyze data for research purposes.
